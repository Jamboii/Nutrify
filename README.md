# Nutrify

This project is intended to combat the social issue of obesity/anorexia. The premise of the Nutrify is a mobile application that will act as a self-help and nutritional guide to achieving a desired weight goal in a certain amount of time.

The application aims to discipline, motivate, and engage users in an environment that rewards them for completing progress towards their goal. It objectively should be an intermediary device that sits between the user and their weight goals, and measures itself based on self-evaluation. Calorie counting is a process that can easily be improved with automations that are easy to use on-the-go and provide a lot more information to the user. By additionally incentivizing usage by tracking weekly progress, being informative with the user, and entertainment such as games, the application will be able to actively influence the user to make better nutritional choices to combat the issue of obesity or anorexia.
